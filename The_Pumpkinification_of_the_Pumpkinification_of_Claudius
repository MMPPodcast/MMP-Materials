It is disturbingly easy to break your life down into story beats.

If you were asked to, it would probably take you a matter of minutes to sift through every experience that you remember, separating what's useful from what's not. Not just that, but you could spin your life into /several/ stories - each with a different set of events, sometimes overlapping but framed in different ways, conveying a different mood and serving a different purpose. The same memory could be a comedic vignette in one story and a meaningful turning point in another. The absolute crux of one story might not even /appear/ in another.

Now imagine spinning stories out of a life you've only heard about /in stories/ - I know, I'm asking you to imagine the entire genre of historical fiction, but bear with me here. Not only would you have to choose which moments to include in your retelling, but whether to keep the pre-attached framing from a previous retelling.

And now, finally, imagine trying to do this all about a life that was, at the very least, uncommonly eventful, and probably a bit closer to batshit insane. We're talking violence, political intruige, and intergenerational incest. But with so much there, and a whole tradition of stories to remix and reframe, how many ways do you think you could spin that?

Hello, everyone! Welcome to The Man, the Myth, the Pumpkin, a podcast where we look at fictionalisations of the emperor Claudius' life and ask ourselves, "Why does this exist?" My name is Sophia Sarro, and thank you for joining me for this weird little academic experiment. 

First of all, I should probably start off with some historical context or this is gonna sound a whole lot weirder than it already is. Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus, who would later become Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, was born in 10 BCE. His father Drusus was the son of the empress Livia, and his mother Antonia Minor was the niece of the emperor Augustus, meaning Claudius would be raised as part of imperial Rome's first dynastic family. 

Whereas most Julio-Claudian boys were raised for military and political careers, Claudius was counted out of those career paths from an early age due to his limp, physical tics, and significant hearing loss, as well as speaking with a stutter. He was instead trained to be a historian. That did not stop him from seeking political office during the reigns of his grandfather Augustus and uncle Tiberius though - although the varying success of these bids led to him going into an early retirement and spending a considerable amount of his time gambling.

During Caligula's reign, he brought his uncle Claudius out of political retirement and appointed him co-consul. And when Caligula was assassinated, his co-consul was a clear contender for his successor. It took a lot of bribes, and the merciless execution of some conspiritors, but the Julio-Claudians' power was restored as Claudius was declared emperor.

Speedrun of his reign: Aqueducts were built. Rome conquered Brittania. Claudius put his own wife, Valeria Messalina, to death after she was /allegedly/ plotting to overthrow him. He proposed two new letters of the Latin alphabet; they didn't catch on. And in 54 CE, he died after naming his stepson Nero as his political heir.

I cannot emphasize this enough: it is /HARD/ to condense sixty-four years into a matter of seconds. But now that you have my slapdash version of Claudius's life, you're ready for Seneca the Younger's far more thought-out rendition of his /afterlife/. Let's talk Apokolokintosis. 

[musical interlude]

The satire which we now know as /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ was attributed to Seneca the Younger by Cassius Dio.

Compared to whatever the title is supposed to be, the plot is fairly simple.
Compared to the  dies and ascends to heaven, where he promptly terrifies Hercules just by showing up. He attempts to smooth-talk the gods into letting him stay in heaven, but Augustus cuts in and tells everyone what a horrible person he was. He's then sent to Hell, doomed to spend eternity gambling with a bottomless dice box that won't actually let him toss his dice, only for Caligula to swoop in, claim him, and then give him as a gift to [freedman] who uses him as his law clerk for eternity. Not exactly the same idyllic fate that awaited his grandfather Augustus, who ended up living amongst the gods after death.

The intersection between Classical studies and disability studies has been booming lately, and it’s a bit late but we can still give the obligatory round of applause. And of course, being one of the most famous people in the ancient world - and thus, one of the people we know most about - Claudius has been at the forefront of many of these discussions. Personally, I want to give Classicists the benefit of the doubt here - that we’re talking the most about him because he’s one of the most well-attested physically disabled people in both the literary and archaeological records, and not because he was rich and poor people are boring. Because he was so far removed from the average Roman, his relationship with disability must likewise be understood to be different than that of someone who wasn’t emperor.

And the relationship of each /fictional/ Claudius with disability is different not only from that of the average Roman, or that of the historical Claudius, but from that of each other. Depending on what the work is trying to say, it’s going to be skewed differently. 

And on that note, let’s talk about Hercules - Hi, I’m Sophia Sarro, and this is The Man, The Myth, The Melted Blob of Flesh Murdered by Deianira. [Beat.] No. What I mean is, let’s talk about the nearly invincible Hercules being scared shitless of an elderly - and recently deceased - man. 

To a modern audience, the joke is as obvious as it is unfunny: someone known for his strength, virility, and […] is afraid of someone who couldn’t pose a threat to him if he tried. It’s the old lion-afraid-of-a-mouse trope, just as shallow here as it is in any children’s cartoon - /I thought/. But when you think of Hercules as the pinnacle of virility, repulsed by the physically disabled and morally slimy Claudius, things get a lot more interesting. Because virtue and control - both control over others and control over yourself - were generally considered masculine traits in ancient Rome. 

And this is the start of a centuries-long through-line that connects every depiction of Claudius we’re going to look at: the connection between disability and gender. Hercules is shuddering not only at the sight of a disabled person, but at the gaping vacuum standing in place of Roman masculinity. And then you start to realise, /none/ of the masculine male characters like Claudius. Hercules, as the pinnacle of virility, is of course the most disgusted. But Augustus calls him disgusting. And when Claudius attempts to gain favour by using his oratory skill - a very gendered skill for the ancient Romans - Augustus even cuts in to call his bluff, taking away the one form of masculine power he was able to assert.

The only two men in the narrative who so much as tolerate him are Caligula and [freedman]. Caligula’s masculinity is already called into question by virtue of…being Caligula. And [Freedman] is a freedman, whose masculinity was undercut by his previous enslavement. Remember that notion of control: free-born Roman men were supposed to be the most masculine on the spectrum of Roman gender, mainly because they had the most control over those around them. And yet, this man who was once enslaved subjugates the former Roman emperor and claims him as his law clerk, bumping Claudius down further on this Roman gender scale. 

For what it’s worth, Caligula also wants to control Claudius - again, by virtue of being Caligula. He even outright claims that Claudius was his [slave] - his slave - during life. And this is particularly interesting because historical Claudius had a turbulent relationship with the political sphere before becoming emperor. His family decided very early on that he was not fit for political life, leading to him being trained as a historian instead of a politician. Still, in spite of evidently liking his craft - or at least, generating a prolific output - he still strove for whatever political offices he could get. He went into retirement early when it became clear that Tiberius would give him only the robes of [office], but not any of the political duties. Being Caligula’s […] was a return for politics, and in spite of it not being a particularly glamorous or gratifying job - Suetonius tells of Caligula throwing him in a river at one point, and whether or not that actually happened it gets the point across - this could very easily be framed as Claudius regaining some measure of control in his life. That makes the inversion here - portraying it as enslavement - a particularly cruel jab.

So, the gods hate him, his grandfather hates him, and his nephew and freedman put up with him because they know they can control him. Does anyone actually like this Claudius? Surprisingly, yes - but unsurprisingly, given what we’ve just discussed in terms of masculinity, it’s exclusively the female characters. [Fever] cuts his life “mercifully” short - and yes, Seneca leans /hard/ into the idea that it’s better to be dead than to be disabled. If you think that’s an antiquated idea, just wait for the rest of this series - that idea sticks around for /far/ longer than it should.

And then we have this conspicuous line, near the beginning of the story: cue line about Nero being young and handsome.

Oh, and since we’re back to Nero, it might be time to ask ourselves why this exists. After all, Seneca is writing under Nero - possibly writing this particular satire for the first Saturnalia during Nero’s reign - and it doesn’t seem particularly conducive to claim that the one who named the current leader as his successor - who also happened to be said leader’s great-uncle, stepfather, /and/ father-in-law - was some effeminate Gaul with a godawful temper. And that’s why it’s theorised that this was written for Saturnalia - because inversions like this, and poking fun at the people you were supposed to revere, was part of the holiday.

But it also serves a secondary purpose, setting Nero up as the leader who will bring Roman masculinity back into the political sphere. (With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that it’s good that Seneca only mentioned Nero in passing, as he would otherwise risk undermining his own goal.)


"But wait," you say, "this story is named after pumpkins! And this /podcast/ is named after this story which is named after pumpkins! You're telling me we get one dice box shaped like a gourd flower at the very beginning, and then nothing? Where are the pumpkins?"

So, there are two theories about that. The first, and longest-standing theory, is shich was put forth by [name]

And I'm glad you asked, because the title of this work worth examining. First of all, the title /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ comes to us from Cassius Dio, which explains why this Latin satire has a partially Greek name. Apolokintosis is a combination of the words apotheosis, which means ascention to godhood, and kolokynt, which means - say it with me, everyone - gourd. Dio even glosses this title, implying that his audience would not have necessarily understood the joke off the bat. And even after the gloss, the audience still might not have gotten it. It's not like kolokynt was a common insult. And scholars hypothesize that this might have been the point: the title is as unexpected and /wrong/ as Claudius's time as emperor. 

And of course, the common English translation "pumpkinification" came about centuries later, after Europeans learned that squash existed. The title isn't static. This title has an ambiguous meaning that continues to change depending on its cultural context. If that doesn't sum up the material we're dealing with, I don't know what does.
