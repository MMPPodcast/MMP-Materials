The life of the emperor Claudius was, if nothing else, eventful.

Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus was born in Lugdunum, Gaul, on August 1st, 10 BCE, to Drusus the Elder - son of the empress Livia - and Antonia Minor - daughter of Mark Antony. Drusus died shortly after Claudius's birth, leaving Antonia to raise Claudius and his older siblings, Germanicus and Livilla, herself. After being singled out as unfit for a political career due to his physical disabilities and speech impediment, Claudius was instead trained to be a historian. 

Whether by the machinations of Agrippina the Younger, or - far more likely - because he was reaching the upper eschelons of age for a Roman man, Claudius died on October 13th, 54 CE. Thus, a very eventful life finally reached its end.

And within a year, another Claudius was born - a fictional Claudius, most likely concocted by Seneca the Younger to make Claudius's successor Nero look good. Before long, even more Claudii were born on the pages of Suetonius and Tacitus and Josephus. Eventually, the principate ended; the reimagining of Claudius did not. Throughout the following centuries and into the modern day, more and more Claudii accumulated, each one tailored to the time period and genre for which he was created.

So, with 2,000 years worth of reimaginings to sift through, I guess we'd better get started.

Hello, everyone! Welcome to The Man, the Myth, the Pumpkin, a podcast where we look at fictionalisations of the emperor Claudius' life and ask ourselves, "Why does this exist?" Thank you for joining us for this weird little academic experiment. 

In terms of fictional Claudii, it only seems right to start with the original. 

The satire which we now know as /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ - whether or not that was its original title - was attributed to Seneca the Younger by Cassius Dio. 



"But wait," you say, "this story is named after pumpkins! And this /podcast/ is named after this story which is named after pumpkins! Where were the pumpkins?" 

And I'm glad you asked, because the title of this work worth examining. First of all, the title /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ comes to us from Cassius Dio, which explains why this Latin satire has a partially Greek name. Apolokintosis is a combination of the words apotheosis, which means ascention to godhood, and kolokynt, which means - say it with me, everyone - gourd. Dio even glosses this title, implying that his audience would not have necessarily understood the joke off the bat. And even after the gloss, the audience still might not have gotten it. It's not like kolokynt was a common insult. And scholars hypothesize that this might have been the point: the title is as unexpected and /wrong/ as Claudius's time as emperor. 

And of course, the common English translation "pumpkinification" came about centuries later, after Europeans learned that squash existed. The title isn't static. This title has an ambiguous meaning that continues to change depending on its cultural context. If that doesn't sum up the material we're dealing with, I don't know what does.
