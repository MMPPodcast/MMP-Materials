When's the last time you asked yourself, "Why does this exist?"

It might have been right before you clicked on this podcast.

Hello, everyone! Welcome to The Man, the Myth, the Pumpkin, a podcast where we look at fictionalisations of the emperor Claudius' life and ask ourselves, "Why does this exist?" Thank you for joining us for this weird little academic experiment. 

In terms of fictional Claudii, it only seems right to start with the original. 

The satire which we now know as /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ was attributed to Seneca the Younger by Cassius Dio.

Compared to whatever the title is supposed to be, the plot is fairly simple.
Compared to the  dies and ascends to heaven, where he promptly terrifies Hercules just by showing up. He attempts to smooth-talk the gods into letting him stay in heaven, but Augustus cuts in and tells everyone what a horrible person he was. He's then sent to Hell, doomed to spend eternity gambling with a bottomless dice box that won't actually let him toss his dice, only for Caligula to swoop in, claim him, and then give him as a gift to [freedman] who uses him as his law clerk for eternity. Not exactly the same idyllic fate that awaited his grandfather Augustus, who ended up living amongst the gods after death.

"But wait," you say, "this story is named after pumpkins! And this /podcast/ is named after this story which is named after pumpkins! You're telling me we get one dice box shaped like a gourd flower at the very beginning, and then nothing? Where are the pumpkins?"

So, there are two theories about that. The first, and longest-standing theory, is shich was put forth by [name]

And I'm glad you asked, because the title of this work worth examining. First of all, the title /Apolokintosis divi Claudii/ comes to us from Cassius Dio, which explains why this Latin satire has a partially Greek name. Apolokintosis is a combination of the words apotheosis, which means ascention to godhood, and kolokynt, which means - say it with me, everyone - gourd. Dio even glosses this title, implying that his audience would not have necessarily understood the joke off the bat. And even after the gloss, the audience still might not have gotten it. It's not like kolokynt was a common insult. And scholars hypothesize that this might have been the point: the title is as unexpected and /wrong/ as Claudius's time as emperor. 

And of course, the common English translation "pumpkinification" came about centuries later, after Europeans learned that squash existed. The title isn't static. This title has an ambiguous meaning that continues to change depending on its cultural context. If that doesn't sum up the material we're dealing with, I don't know what does.
