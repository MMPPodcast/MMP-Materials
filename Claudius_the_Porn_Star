Sex, death, and violence: three constant through-lines of human existance. 
 
I, Claudius had its fair share of hard-to-watch scenes, although the hardest - a scene of Caligula carving a foetus out of a dead Drusilla and eating her - was infamously cut. 

"King? Well, but this is a Republic, isn't it?"

"One month of games, and a gold coin for every Roman, to celebrate the birth of my son - MY. SON. - Julia Drusilla!"

Caligula meet Ceasonia while crossdressing as a priestess of Isis.
Caligula has a group of "homosexuals who've been castrated" guard Caesonia - and keep her on a leash. 
He kills a man while wearing a dress.
Caligula is in the habit of strutting flamboyantly and striking poses, a number of which involve at least one limp wrist. 

His first appearance is sitting poolside while Tiberius bathes with his "little fishies." Tiberius commands Caligula to do the dance he used to entertain his father's soldiers with as a child, and Claudius laughs, but not maliciously. He doesn't understand that he's witnessing a cruel power play on Tiberius's part; he just sees his nephew doing a funny dance. 

He ends that scene by being kicked into the pool by Caligula, which isn't entirely undeserved. And while Claudius is presumably floundering around, trying to get himself out of the pool, what are Tiberius and Caligula doing? Well, they're just having a nice chat as they take a walk...straight into an orgy. 

In the middle of this conversation, Tiberius tells Caligula that he'll die, before descending in what looks to be a manpowered elevator and just leaving Caligula there. Caligula races through the orgy and down multiple flights of stairs to catch up. He reunites with Tiberius on the bottom floor, where the lights are lower and the orgy is...different. There's a person with two noses, two mouths, and three eyes. One man has two hands growing out of each wrist. Twins, conjoined at the head, look on in indifference as a man lowers himself onto a large, metal toy. 

I was surprised that people with physical disabilities and [....] are not sexually active in Gore Vidal's vision, but they are standing amongst the action. 

Gemellus, who is clearly still a teenager, joins them there, although he doesn't enjoy or even take notice of the ongoings surrounding him. But where's Claudius? Either still in the pool, pulling himself out of the pool, or heading away from the pool; either way, he's not here.

Claudius plays dice next to Tiberius's death bed, which even Gemellus seems weirded out by.
Tiberius: You prefer nyphs to satyrs?
Caligula: I like both, Lord.
Tiberius: One needs both. Yes. To keep healthy. 

When Tiberius asks whether Tiberius prefers nymphs or satyrs, Caligula says, "I like both, Lord." Tiberius, who has his "little fishies", replies, "One needs both. Yes. To keep healthy." It's probably worth noting that depending on the cut of the movie you watch, even Gemellus has a same-sex encounter with a guard. And what do these guys have in common? They're members of the imperial family, and during the course of the movie, they die. The only member of the imperial family who doesn't die throughout the course of the film? Claudius.



Claudius looks on in horror as Caligula is stabbed to death, clutching his comically large dice, before immediately ducking behind the first pillar he sees. He's found /literally immediately/, drops down to his knees, and within a matter of seconds is crowned and foisted onto the Praetorian Guards' shoulders as they chant "Hail Claudius Caesar." He drops the crown as soon as it's put on his head, but his dice are still firmly in hand as the Praetorian Guard carry him away - as simultaneously, Caligula's corpse is laid out on the steps besides Caesonia's. Longinus picks up the crown and Tiberius's signet ring and takes off running. 

First, a rundown of both films. /Caligula/, which obviously takes place first, follows the titular emperor's desent from mild perversion to complete corruption and his assassination by the praetorian guard. Despite Claudius the historical figure having been politically active throughout Caligula's reign, Claudius the character does not show up until the very end, when he is unwillingly made emperor a la /Antiquities of the Jews/.

/Messalina, Messalina!/ picks back up a few years later, during Claudius's expedition to Ostia in 62 CE. The "plot" consists of Messalina seeking power by sleeping with various people, until Claudius shows up at the end and puts everyone to death in an extended, gratuitious gore scene.

Now, just from these descriptions alone we can see an important parallel: in both movies, Claudius does not appear until the end. More specifically, Claudius only appears at the tail end of a taboo sexcapade put to an end by violence - in one case his own violence, in the other the violence of a third party. In both of these films about sex, Claudius's appearance marks that the sex, and what is encapsulated by the sex - the perversion, the corruption - has come to an end. 

In /Messalina, Messalina!/, every character engaging in sex is able-bodied. In /Caligula/, there actually is a depiction of disabled people having sex - a fetishistic, disgusting depiction. In the film, Tiberius has a "human zoo" filled with people with various disabilities and birth defects. Picture a Victorian sideshow, but everyone is having sex for the benefit of one extremely powerful, extremely perverted old man. The orgy in the human zoo is portrayed as part of a chain of debauchery, proceeded by Caligula's incest with his sister and Tiberius bathing with his "little fish." Like incest and borderline-pedophilia, the human zoo orgy is supposed to be erotic by virtue of being taboo. That's worth repeating: /sexual relations between people with disabilities/ is framed as being erotic by being "so wrong that it's right." It's an inversion of what society considers correct. 

That in and of itself is an ugly thought. But did the filmmaker's assumption, that sex between disabled people would be received as "so wrong that it's right", actually play out with his audience? 

The other massive variable that these films play with is gender. In /Caligula/, Claudius is de-sexed by being literally excluded from the sex. /Messalina, Messalina/ takes this theme even further, by focusing on Messalina continually cheating on and, as a result, immasculating Claudius without his knowledge. As we've discussed...this Roman idea that to be masculine is to be in control, both of yourself and of those around you. To be subjugated to forces that are more powerful than you is inherently feminizing. And the only thing more emasculating than losing control of your wife is for said wife to commandeer your political power.

...Which leads us to the bloodbath scene. You know what a great way to exert control is? Violence... It is especially interesting for Claudius to be leading the charge here, as he was deprived of the opportunity to prove his masculinity through war in his youth. And at the bizarre crossroads of imperial Rome and sexploitation films, we find ourselves at another crossroads: the place where disability and gender intersect. 

So in the end Claudius reclaims his manhood, and Rome is saved from having a sexually empowered woman make political decisions. Nice.

So, let's talk about that nifty "audience reception" thing, which we've started having access to as our sources have gotten more recent. Remember all that legal trouble that /Caligula/ got in, allowing for /Messalina, Messalina/ to be made? It's okay if you don't, you've been inundated with a whole lot of insanity since the beginning of the episode. Anyway...
