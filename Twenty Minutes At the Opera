Upon hearing that Claudius has died, Agrippina pushes for Nero to become the next princeps - to Nero's reluctant acceptance. Everything is going great for Agrippina until Lesbus bursts into Nero's coronation ceremony to announce that Claudius has actually survived thanks to the intervention of Otho, who Claudius has named as his heir as thanks for saving his life. 

Otho, in a moment of lapsed judgement, tells the famously crafty Agrippina that he is in love with Poppaea. With this knowledge, Agrippina can set a new plot in motion. She tells Poppaea that Claudius did not name Otho as his heir solely because he saved his life, but because Otho agreed to step down from pursuing Poppaea and essentially /gave her to Claudius/. She tells Poppea that if she wants to get even, she should tell Claudius that Otho told her not to show Claudius any affection, thereby making Claudius believe that Otho has broken his end of the deal. Poppea is completely tricked and follows Agrippina's advice.

Claudius calls Otho a traitor in front of everyone, and Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero likewise reject him, leaving him both sad and ridiculously confused - one moment he's saving the emperor's life, and the next, the emperor and everyone in his inner circle despise him. Otho's despair motivates Poppaea to make up with him, and his sincere confusion sparks doubt that he actually struck that deal in the first place. Like Agrippina, she hatches a plan: Poppaea pretends to talk in her sleep when she knows Otho will overhear, recounting what Agrippina told her. In doing so, she keys Otho into what's going on and baits him into professing his innocence. Just as Poppaea and Otho are set up to take revenge on Agrippina, there's another massive complication - Nero bursts in and declares his love for Poppaea.

This complete mess of deceit is solved by - you guessed it - more deceit! Poppaea convinces Otho and Nero to hide in her bedroom, and when Claudius comes, tricks Nero into coming out of hiding and attempting to win her over right in front of Claudius. Claudius sends Nero away and leaves. Otho comes out of hiding, and the lovebirds tell each other how in love they are. Nero learns from this experience that love has nothing on power, and announces to Agrippina that he is now going to focus on ascending to power like she wanted him to. Pallas and Narcissus, meanwhile, tell Claudius what's been going on. He confronts Agrippina, who tells him that on the contrary, she was actually making sure that the trone would remain /his/. Somehow, he believes this, and decides to grant everyone what he believes, based on what he has seen so far, would make them happy - he reinstates Otho as his heir, and declares that Nero will get to marry Poppaea. Once he learns that he missed out on /a lot/, he reverses the decision so that Nero will get the throne and Otho will get to marry Poppaea. The opera ends with him summoning Juno from on high to bless everyone.

Traditionally, the male and female leads are written as tenors and sopranos respectively. The tenor in particular is supposed to be "a reconstruction of what was supposed to be the ideal heroic sound," according to [...]. There is no tenor part in this opera. There is, however, a contralto - namely Otho - who acts as the love interest to one of the two soprano leads.  

Given that the story begins with Agrippina excited that Claudius is allegedly dead, it makes sense that he is not the tenor to her soprano - he, like Pallas and Lesbus, is a bass. Given that Pallas and Lesbus both serve under Claudius, it is entirely possible that giving these three the deepest vocal parts is an expression of Claudius's masculine authority. While Agrippina and Poppea make most of the decisions within the story, it is Claudius who has the final say. The main conflict of the story, in fact, is these two women trying to enact their own will /around/ Claudius's authority. He is not in charge of the story, but he /is/ in charge of everyone in it. Claudius is the one who ultimately grants everyone their happy ending, and who calls down Juno in the end. As such, he does not get the hero's voice, but he does get a deep, commanding, and unambiguously masculine voice.

Interestingly, Narcissus, the other freedman who has been portrayed as Pallas's other half since Suetonius's Lives of the Caesars, has a different voice than everyone else who is directly under Claudius's authority. He is an alto castrato - and yes, "castrato" means that the singer was castrated before his voice had a chance to drop, preserving his higher vocal range. Given that Pallas and Narcissus are always portrayed in tandem - and in Act II, they reach the conclusion that Agrippina has tricked them /together/ - 


Luckily, I'm here to report that with a basic knowledge of grammar, an online lexicon, and so much unearned confidence it borders on delusion, anything is possible!
