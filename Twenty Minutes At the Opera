/Agrippina/ was composed by George Frideric Handel, with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. The opera was written for Venice's Carnevale, a raucous pre-Lent celebration marked by parades, costumes, and social inversions. Fittingly for that kind of celebration, Handel and Vincenzo came out with an amoral, ahistorical satire that turned the well-known story of Agrippina and Nero on its head and allowed audiences to root for the scheming, power-hungry mother and her puppet of a son.

The story is as follows: Upon hearing that Claudius has died, Agrippina pushes for Nero to become the next princeps - to Nero's reluctant acceptance. Everything is going great for Agrippina learns that Claudius has actually survived thanks to the intervention of Otho, who Claudius has named as his heir as thanks for saving his life. 

Otho, in a moment of lapsed judgement, tells the famously crafty Agrippina that he is in love with Poppaea. With this knowledge, Agrippina approaches Poppaea and tells her the exact opposite - that Otho said he'd let Claudius pursue her in exchane for being named heir. She suggests that if Poppaea wants to get even, she should trick Claudius into thinking Otho didn't intend to hold up his end of the deal. Poppaea is completely duped and follows Agrippina's advice.

Claudius calls Otho a traitor in front of everyone, and Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero likewise reject him, leaving him both sad and ridiculously confused - one moment he's saving the emperor's life, and the next, the emperor and everyone in his inner circle despise him. Otho's despair motivates Poppaea to make up with him, and his sincere confusion sparks doubt that he actually struck that deal in the first place. Like Agrippina, Poppaea carries out a scheme to clue Otho in on what's going on and bait him into professing his innocence. The two love birds are now poised to expose Agrippina's scheming - until Nero bursts in and declares his love for Poppaea.

This complete mess of deceit is solved by - you guessed it - more deceit! Poppaea convinces Otho and Nero to hide in her bedroom, and when Claudius comes, tricks Nero into coming out of hiding and attempting to win her over right in front of Claudius. Claudius sends Nero away and leaves. Otho comes out of hiding, and the lovebirds tell each other how in love they are. Nero learns from this experience that love has nothing on power, and announces to Agrippina that he is now going to focus on ascending to power like she wanted him to. Pallas and Narcissus, meanwhile, tell Claudius what's been going on. He confronts Agrippina, who tells him that on the contrary, she was actually making sure that the trone would remain /his/. Somehow, he believes this, and decides to grant everyone what he believes, based on what he has seen so far, would make them happy - he reinstates Otho as his heir, and declares that Nero will get to marry Poppaea. Once he learns that he missed out on /a lot/, he reverses the decision so that Nero will get the throne and Otho will get to marry Poppaea. The opera ends with him summoning Juno from on high to bless everyone.

Now, that was pretty long for a summary. And if you're wondering, "Did we really need all that?" I would argue that yes, we did, because the pushes and pulls of human agency are the driving force of this story. This is an interesting cast of characters through which to explore the concepts of agency and control, and Grimani takes full advantage of that. True to the spirit of topsy-turvy Carnevale, the man who has the most political power - Claudius - has the least power to change the narrative, whereas the man with the most narrative power - Otho - relinquishes that same political power to bring closure to the narrative. 

Before the narrative even starts, Otho kicks off the chain of events by saving Claudius's life, thus preventing Nero from ascending to power as Agrippina had hoped. In fact, when he first apears on stage, Agrippina, Narcissus, Pallas, and Nero all say in unison, "Here comes the main cause of my affliction." Otho is a /cause/ - he's an active agent; he makes things happen. Likewise, by being unspeakably naive and choosing to tell Agrippina of all people about his love life, Otho gives her the information she needs to concoct a scheme and push the plot even further. Claudius, meanwhile, is more of an obstacle to get around. Even when Claudius exerts his power and grants everyone a happy ending, he is merely doing what the others have led him to do through their schemes. And the biggest display of power within the entire opera, calling down a literal goddess to bless everyone, has effectively no bearing on the plot because everything has already been resolved.

So Otho, the contralto and thus the defacto hero of the story, who even gets the girl in the end as comedic heroes tend to do, has agency - but he uses that agency to royally screw everyone over twice, first by saving Claudius and then by trusting Agrippina. But you know who else has agency over the narrative, and uses it a lot more wisely than our hero? The two Roman women, whose alleged scheming was usually decried in historical sources. While Agrippina was infamous for trying to secure the throne for Nero, Poppaea did not escape her share of allegations of being a gold-digger who married Otho and later Nero for proximity to power. But here, the women's scheming is an integral part of the plot; by doing exactly what a respectable Roman woman should not do, Agrippina and Poppaea outsmart the men in their lives, push the plot forward, and bring everyone that much closer to their respective happy ending.

And speaking of happy endings, everyone comes out of this happier, healthier, and more /alive/ than they did historically. More than that, the characters who openly tell the audience about their self-serving schemes end the story with exactly what would make them the happiest. It's important to note that Handel and Grimani simply did not have the same constraints while writing as Suetonius, Tacitus, or Cassius Dio. Not only are they not bound (loosely) by the events of history, but they are not writing to inform their audiences of what a good Roman, or a good leader, should be. The stakes for Handel and Vincenzo are also notably lower. People who don't appear on stage obviously exist in the world of this opera, but they're basically window dressing - someone for Otho to have fought, a reason for Claudius to have been away. It's not the identity and viability of the Roman empire that's at stake here, but the love lives of Poppaea and Otho, and whether Nero makes his mother proud. It's okay for Handel and Vincenzo to reward morally grey characters in a way that Sueotonius could not risk doing. 

Additionally, by doing so in the midst of the Carnevale season, Handel and Grimani could inspire their audience to think of amoral people in power without calling them out outright and upsetting anyone above them. This was especially important for Grimani, a Cardinal who was at odds with his superior, Pope Clement the Eleventh. If he could hint to the public that the person at the top - in this case, Claudius - is clueless as to what anyone below him wants or needs, and wouldn't get anything done without those below him acting /around/ and /in spite of/ him, he could make a general enough statement which still reflected his current plight, without saying "this pope is trash because he doesn't like the Hapsburgs as much as I do."

Out of all the tweaks and outright retcons to the historical narrative, there's one in particular that I'd like to draw your attention to: this version of Claudius is notably without his stutter, and no one mocks or even mentions his physical disabilities. I think this is for political reasons - Handel and Grimani want the most politically powerful figure in the story to be undercut not by anything beyond his control, but by his inability to see what is going on in front of him and act accordingly, which he could probably do if he actually bothered to pay attention. This makes a stronger case against other powerful figures that Claudius could represent - (cough) Pope Clement - that any reason for him being ineffective and disliked is due to his own choices.

But while we don't find ourselves at the intersection between ability and gender, we /do/ find ourselves at the intersection between /agency/ and gender. The characters who act with the most forethought, and thus get what closer to what they want through the choices they make, are female. And while Claudius is afforded more agency socially by being male, he squanders it by being totally controlled by the women in his life - a less extreme version of the recurring trope of him being a failed leader and a failed Roman man. 

The fact that this is an eighteenth-century opera also means that there's a lot to talk about in terms of gender alone, and it would be nearly not to get into such a fascinating facet of what's going on here. The long and short of it is, gender in opera is a lot less binary than one might expect - than I expected - and that says a lot about [...].

In eighteenth century opera, the hero of the story was either written as a tenor or a contralto. In Agrippina, Otho fills the contralto role, thus making him the hero and male - or "male," in air quotes - lead. See, Otho, an indisputably male character, is written for the lowest female vocal range. And as it turns out, that's just /a thing that happened/ back then. Travesti roles, roles in which actors played characters of the opposite sex, 

Also noteworthy is the fact that Nero is written as a castrato soprano - the highest male vocal range, achieved by - just like it sounds - castrating the performer before he hits puberty and his voice begins to drop. This is fascinating because while the ancient Romans were no strangers to the concept of castration, they weren't particularly fond of it. Ancient historians frequently associate eunuchs with the excesses of Egypt, Anatolia, and other non-Roman powers, mainly in order to other and emasculate foreign men. Suetonius even tries to demean and criticize Nero by bringing up his assiciation to a castrated boy - claiming that Nero had the boy, whose name was Sporus, stripped of his testicles before literally marrying him. Sporus, was supposed fill the void left by Poppaea after Nero - who historically did end up marrying Poppaea after all - allegedly killed her. 

So if the emperor marrying a eunuch was a terrible thing brought up as an example of what only the most unfit ruler would do, the emperor /being/ a eunuch? Awful. Unthinkable. Unmanly and un-Roman. But in opera, those same connotations simply weren't there. In her book /Voicing Gender/, Naomi Adele Andre states, "The otherworldly and ethereal voices of the castrati had been uwell suited to entertain the eighteenth-century monarchs whose political, social, and cultural position endowed them with supreme rights: they represented an embodiment of divine power." Nero being portrayed by a castrato isn't a dig at his masculinity, as it would have been in ancient times; instead, his voice gives him a captivating and compelling presence.

But do you know whose voice is far less unique? You guessed it, Claudius. Whereas the novelty of Otho and Nero's voices grip the audience's attention and put them in a suspension of disbelief, Claudius's bass is just more /believable/. It's a voice that a person might expect to come out of a man on the street, just like it's coming out of the man on the stage, and that makes Claudius stand out a lot less. While bass was a versatile part in opera, voicing everything from servants to kings, the bass was rarely the main character - and rarely got the girl, if Agrippina's excitement at Claudius being dead didn't clue you in already. Being written as the bass underscores the fact that while Claudius should hypothetically have the most power out of anyone in the cast, he cannot effectively weild this power to enact his own will. In other words, even as the most powerful figure in the Roman world at the time, he can't make himself the main character. This simply isn't his story.

If we're going to answer the overarching question of why this exists, a good place to start would be, why set your allegory about how much you hate the current pope in pre-Christian Rome?  Thankfully, since imperial Rome was such a popular setting for operas, scholars much more capable than myself have answered this. In his article Why Early Opera Is Roman and Not Greek, Robert C. Ketterer asserts that the autocratic set-up of imperial Rome served as a better mirror for the societies that would consume early opera than, say, democratic Greece. Another argument that Ketterer explores, which I think gels incredibly well with what we see in /Agrippina/, is that the "lack of restraint" which characterized the Baroque period had a striking parallel in the well-documented excesses of ancient Rome. While Romans held themselves to a cultural standard of austerity, those who shirked that expectation and indulged themselves - particularly those in power, who could afford to do so on a massive scale - were led some of the most well-documented lives of their time, allowing Baroque-era writers to draw inspiration from them. Conversely, the culture that birthed sophrosune and the Aristotelian mean just couldn't measure up when it came to lavish excess. 

Oh, and that concept of putting your culture's most indulgent and thoughtless moments on display, as a notable exception to the rule? That might have been something Venetian Catholics could relate to, as they publically partied harder than usual in preparation for the austerity of Lent.

So, Agrippina serves as a thought-provoking exploration of agency, and a warning that those with the most power might be the least effective at using it, wrapped up in a narrative that is, above all, fun. Remember, this was written for party time, as much as it was meant to give people something to chew on in the coming days of Lent. And while Clement the Eleventh is no longer a political obstacle in today's world, the fact that people are still engaging with Handel and Grimani's statements on power mean that they absolutely succeeded in getting their points across.
