You remember being a high school student and thinking "When in the world am I actually going to use this?" Well, it turns out one of the many answers is "while translating a seventeenth century opera for the sake of a Classics podcast." 
At risk of calling my reputability into question, I researched this entire episode firmly believing that "Friedrich George Handel" was a person. 

I actually did the academic version of a double take while reading this. At the back of my mind I was thinking, "God, I'm glad this is in French. I can hardly order a coffee in Italian."

When I said I wanted to get back into studying manuscripts, this was not what I had in mind.
