Content warning up front: this episode contains mentions of domestic violence. The timestamps will be provided in the description, so that you can skip over that part if you want to.

Upon hearing that Claudius has died, Agrippina pushes for Nero to become the next princeps - to Nero's reluctant acceptance. Everything is going great for Agrippina until Lesbus bursts into Nero's coronation ceremony to announce that Claudius has actually survived thanks to the intervention of Otho, who Claudius has named as his heir as thanks for saving his life. 

Otho, in a moment of lapsed judgement, tells the famously crafty Agrippina that he is in love with Poppaea. With this knowledge, Agrippina can set a new plot in motion. She tells Poppaea that Claudius did not name Otho as his heir solely because he saved his life, but because Otho agreed to step down from pursuing Poppaea and essentially /gave her to Claudius/. She tells Poppea that if she wants to get even, she should tell Claudius that Otho told her not to show Claudius any affection, thereby making Claudius believe that Otho has broken his end of the deal. Poppea is completely tricked and follows Agrippina's advice.

Claudius calls Otho a traitor in front of everyone, and Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero likewise reject him, leaving him both sad and ridiculously confused - one moment he's saving the emperor's life, and the next, the emperor and everyone in his inner circle despise him. Otho's despair motivates Poppaea to make up with him, and his sincere confusion sparks doubt that he actually struck that deal in the first place. Like Agrippina, she hatches a plan: Poppaea pretends to talk in her sleep when she knows Otho will overhear, recounting what Agrippina told her. In doing so, she keys Otho into what's going on and baits him into professing his innocence. Just as Poppaea and Otho are set up to take revenge on Agrippina, there's another massive complication - Nero bursts in and declares his love for Poppaea.

This complete mess of deceit is solved by - you guessed it - more deceit! Poppaea convinces Otho and Nero to hide in her bedroom, and when Claudius comes, tricks Nero into coming out of hiding and attempting to win her over right in front of Claudius. Claudius sends Nero away and leaves. Otho comes out of hiding, and the lovebirds tell each other how in love they are. Nero learns from this experience that love has nothing on power, and announces to Agrippina that he is now going to focus on ascending to power like she wanted him to. Pallas and Narcissus, meanwhile, tell Claudius what's been going on. He confronts Agrippina, who tells him that on the contrary, she was actually making sure that the trone would remain /his/. Somehow, he believes this, and decides to grant everyone what he believes, based on what he has seen so far, would make them happy - he reinstates Otho as his heir, and declares that Nero will get to marry Poppaea. Once he learns that he missed out on /a lot/, he reverses the decision so that Nero will get the throne and Otho will get to marry Poppaea. The opera ends with him summoning Juno from on high to bless everyone.

Now, that was pretty long for a summary. And if you're wondering, "Did we really need all that?" I would argue yes, because the pushes and pulls of human choices are the driving force of this story. It's a tale of agency and morality - or rather, agency and the lack of morality. If you've read Suetonius's Life of Claudius, or anything by anyone who /has/ read Suetonius's Life of Claudius, you'll know that Claudius is frequently said to be controlled by his wives - and yes, that's /wives/ plural, as he had four throughout his life. Two wives in particular - Messalina and Agrippina - became notorious for trying to enact their own political adgenda's right under Claudius's nose - and if you believe the ancient historians who claim Agrippina murdered Claudius to expediate Nero's rise to power, she was the wife who succeeded.

These two women are granted happy endings, alongside Nero, who straight-up says "May cunning and deceit serve my ends!" And the lack of moralizing here is conspicuous, because it raises the question of what purpose this opera serves. [Other opera], written in [year] is noted as being an inspiration for this opera due to its similar plot, but notably does not end well for any of the characters. What was the motivation to take this story, mix it around again, and give every scheming, duplicitous person what they wanted, as opposed to either what they deserved, or what they historically got?/

According to Suetonius, Claudius payed the ultimate price for trusting his wife. But here...he doesn't. Far from it, he gives everyone what they want, and then calls down Juno for a massive group blessing. He has the same moral flaw, but within the world of this opera, it just doesn't matter as much. Nothing matters as much. Suetonius, remember, was writing for /Romans/ - reinforcing Roman identity, and outlining what he believed made a decent ruler. [The librettist] simply did not have this burden on his shoulders. People who don't appear on stage obviously exist in the world of this opera, but they're basically window dressing - someone for Otho to have fought, a reason for Claudius to have been away. It's not the identity and viability of the Roman empire that's at stake here, but the love lives of Poppaea and Otho - and no offense to them, but those stakes are far lower. It's okay for the librettist to reward morally grey characters in a way that Sueotonius could not risk doing.

Agrippina, Narcissus, Pallas, and Nero say in unison, "Here comes the main cause of my affliction." Otho is a /cause/, an active agent. Claudius is more of an obstacle to get around. Claudius has more power within the world of the story, but Otho has more power over the narrative itself. Otho's heroic act of saving Claudius, as much as Agrippina's scheming, kick of entire plot. And again, by deciding to confide in Agrippina about his love for Poppaea, Otho provides the means for Agrippina's scheme to take shape. When Claudius grants everyone a happy ending, he is merely doing what the others have led him to do through their schemes. Even the biggest display of power within the entire opera, calling down a literal goddess, has effectively no bearing on the plot because everything has already been resolved.

This is an interesting cast of characters through which to explore the concept of control, and [librettist] takes full advantage. The man who has the most political power has the least narrative power, and the man with the most narrative power relinquishes that same political power to bring closure to the narrative. 

Nero giving up on Poppaea in exchange for political power insinuates that he will not marry her in the future, which may allow her to live a longer and healthier life than her historical counterpart. While the ancient sources differ on the specifics of her death, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Cassius Dio all mention that at least some people believed that Nero was at fault. The most common rumor of her death was domestic abuse, with Nero brutalizing her while she was pregnant, while Tacitus mentions that some people believe she was poisoned. 

Traditionally, the male and female leads are written as tenors and sopranos respectively. The tenor in particular is supposed to be "a reconstruction of what was supposed to be the ideal heroic sound," according to [...]. There is no tenor part in this opera. There is, however, a contralto - namely Otho - who acts as the love interest to one of the two soprano leads.  

If [librettist] stuck to Suetonius's portrayal in one way, it's the fact that Claudius has absolutely zero game. His own wife hopes that he's dead, and the woman that he wishes to see on the side has absolutely no interest in him, despite the fact that he's literally in charge of Rome. And that is a major departure from the source material. 

He is notably not the tenor or contralto to Agrippina's alto - he instead sings bass, which conveys a sense of masculine authority without allowing him to claim the role of love interest or hero.  While Agrippina and Poppea make most of the decisions within the story, it is Claudius who has the final say. The main conflict of the story, in fact, is these two women trying to enact their own will /around/ Claudius's authority. He is not in charge of the story, but he /is/ in charge of everyone in it. Claudius is the one who ultimately grants everyone their happy ending, and who calls down Juno in the end. As such, he does not get the hero's voice, but he does get a deep, commanding, and unambiguously masculine voice.

Interestingly, Narcissus, the other freedman who has been portrayed as Pallas's other half since Suetonius's Lives of the Caesars, has a different voice than everyone else who is directly under Claudius's authority. He is an alto castrato - and yes, "castrato" means that the singer was castrated before his voice had a chance to drop, preserving his higher vocal range. Given that Pallas and Narcissus are always portrayed in tandem - and in Act II, they reach the conclusion that Agrippina has tricked them /together/ - 

In my opinion, the most interesting aspect of this is that this is just /the way things went/ in eighteenth century opera. There are rules about gender and sex in opera that are certainly informed by the outside world, but not dictated by them - on the contrary, the gender norms of the outside world seem to be subverted in opera to create a heightened sense of ethereal otherness, to suck people into the world of the opera and deliniate it sharply from the world off of the stage.

Now take a moment to really reflect on that. This is a story where the scheming women get what they want, and the clueless emperor faces no repurcussions for his incompetence. It's a production in which the actress portraying a goddess also plays the male lead - who is also a future Roman emperor -  and another future emperor is played by a eunuch. Why does this exist? Because two well-established social traditions allowed it to.
