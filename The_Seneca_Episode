The goal of this weird little academic experiment is to pick a historical figure - in this case, the Roman emperor Claudius - and examine several depictions spanning different times, cultures, and genres. Why? Because I hate myself, that's why. 

/[3] Claudius began to give up the ghost, but couldn’t find a way out for it. Then Mercury, who had always had a fancy for his character, led aside one of the three Fates and said: “Why, O hard-hearted woman, do you let the wretched man be tormented? Isn’t he ever to have a rest, after being tortured so long? It is the sixty-fourth year that he has been afflicted with life. What grudge have you got against him and the nation? For once let the prophets tell the truth, who have been taking him off every year, every month even, since he was made emperor. And still it’s no wonder if they go wrong and nobody knows his hour; for nobody ever made any account of his being born. Do what is necessary: ‘Give him over to death: let a better man reign in his place.’”

But Clotho remarked, “I swear I intended to give him a trifle more time, till he should make citizens out of the few that are left outside—for he had made up his mind to see everybody, Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, Britons, wearing togas. However, since it is perhaps a good thing to have a few foreigners left as a nucleus, and since you wish it, it shall be attended to.” Then she opened a bandbox and brought out three spindles; one was that of Augurinus, the next was Baba’s, the third Claudius’. “I will have these three die at short intervals within a year,” she said, “and not send him off unattended. For it isn’t right that one who has been in the habit of seeing so many thousands of people following him about, going ahead of him, and all around him, should all of a sudden be left alone. For a while he will be satisfied with these boon-companions.”

[4] Thus having spoken she wound up the thread on his spindle neglected,
Breaking off the royal days of his stupid existence./



But Lachesis, who herself, too, had a fondness for the handsomest of men, wrought with generous hand, and bestowed upon Nero many years from her own store. 

I love this line, because - while Seneca could not have known this - Nero did not, in fact, have "many years" left. This also speaks to Seneca's ambition in writing this piece: to survive. He has to please Nero, his former pupil and current boss-slash-emperor, so that Nero doesn't dispose of him and replace him with a better yes-man.

/The news was brought to Jupiter that somebody had come, a rather tall man, quite gray-headed; that he was threatening something or other, for he kept shaking his head; and that he limped with his right foot. The messenger said he had asked of what nation he was, but his answer was mumbled in some kind of an incoherent noise; he didn’t recognize the man’s language, but he wasn’t either Greek or Roman or of any known race. Then Jupiter told Hercules, who had travelled all over the world and was supposed to be acquainted with all the nations, to go and find out what sort of a man it was. Hercules at the first sight was a good deal disturbed, even though he was one who didn’t fear any sort of monsters. When he beheld the aspect of this unknown specimen, its extraordinary gait, its voice belonging to no earthly creature but more like that of the monsters of the deep, hoarse and inarticulate, he thought that a thirteenth labor had come to him. When he looked more carefully, however, it appeared to be a man. He approached him and thus spoke, as was easiest for a Greek chap:

Who and whence art thou, and where are thy city and parents?

Claudius was delighted to find literary people there, hoping there would be some place for his histories. So he, too, in a Homeric verse, indicating himself to be Caesar, said:

Hence from Ilium the winds have among the Cicones cast me.

But the following verse would have been truer, and equally Homeric:

There their city I wasted; the people I slaughtered./

So the drawn-out joke here is that Heracles, fearless hero, is afraid of a man with a limp, tics, and a speech impediment. Uncharacteristically afraid.

/[[Fever] said, “It is simple nonsense that he is giving you. I tell you—I who have lived with him for so many years—he was born at Lugudunum; you behold one of Marcus’ citizens. As I’m telling you, he was born sixteen miles from Vienna, a genuine Gaul. And so as a Gaul ought to do, he captured Rome. Take my word for it, he was born at Lugudunum, where Licinus reigned for many years. But you, who have tramped more lands than any wandering muleteer, ought to know men from Lugudunum and that there are a good many miles between the Xanthus and the Rhone.”

Claudius was born outside of Lugdunum, to none other than /Livia's son,/ who was on a military campaign at the time. If the Claudians were some nobody family from Lugdunum, then Nero, being Claudius's great-nephew, stepson, and adopted son, had an equally tenuous claim to leadership.

/Then the divine Augustus arose at the point for expressing his opinion, and discoursed with the utmost eloquence. “I call you to witness, Conscript Fathers,” said he, “that since I was made a god, I have never addressed you; I always mind my own business. And I can no longer disguise my feelings nor conceal the distress that shame makes all the greater. Was it for this that I secured peace on land and sea? For this did I make an end of civil wars? For this did I found the city on a basis of law, adorn it with monuments, that—what to say, Conscript Fathers, I cannot discover. All words are beneath my indignation. So in desperation I must take to the phrase of that most clever man, Messala Corvinus, ‘I am ashamed of my authority.’ This fellow, Conscript Fathers, who doesn’t seem to you as if he could disturb a fly, used to kill people as easily as a dog stops to rest. But why should I enumerate the many great men? I have no heart to lament public calamities when I behold those of my own family. 

Here, Seneca has his cake and eats it too. Claudius is weak, and that is bad; but he's also violent and angry, and that is equally bad. He is terrifying through both his impotence and his ability. 


/Suddenly C. Caesar appeared and began to claim him as a slave. He produced witnesses who had seen Claudius getting thrashed by him with whips, with rods, and with his fists. The man was adjudged to C. Caesar; Caesar presented him to Aeacus; the latter delivered him to Menander his freedman, to be his law-clerk./

The story ends abruptly, with Claudius becoming first the slave to Caligula and then the law-clerk to Menander, his own freedman. 

There are a couple of questions here: If Nero's legitimacy comes from being named as Claudius's heir, what would Seneca gain by writing this? Who was the audience? Why was it written? 

And you probably have a question: "You said you'd come back to that whole pumpkin thing! There wasn't a single pumpkin in that whole story! Where were the pumpkins?" Well my friends, the pumpkins and every other type of squash were all the way across the Atlantic ocean, where Seneca could never have seen them or known of their existence. 

The meaning of Apolokintosis has changed over time, based on cultural context and what the audience has been exposed to. It still has the same root, but different connotations and context change it. And the entire point of this podcast is that the same thing happens with the story of Claudius. Over time, people have taken the facts of his life, reworked them, and portrayed them through a different lens.
