The Man, The Myth, The Podcast:

I was presented with three formats in which I could present my research: a formal thesis, an academic paper, and a creative project. When I asked for an example of what the creative project might look like, I told that another student would be creating a "touch cart" - a display of artifacts that people could not only see and read about, but handle, which would be available for visitors at [where the touch cart is]. That caught my attention immediately. Getting info out the the public was the entire reason that I pursued Classics, and a the one thing that I definitely wanted to do after grad school. If I did a creative project, I would not have to wait until graduation to pursue that goal. My research could be released directly to the public, instead of sequestered in a Master's thesis that no one would read. 

There was only one complication: a touch cart, while being a wonderful format for archaeological research, would be a staggeringly underwhelming way to present a literature-based project. In all likelihood, handling a paperback copy of /I, Claudius/ and a bargain-bin VHS of /Caligula/ would not greatly enhance anyone's educational experience.
