The Man, The Myth, The Podcast:


I was presented with three formats in which I could present my research: a formal thesis, an academic paper, and a creative project. When I asked for an example of what the creative project might look like, I told that another student would be creating a "touch cart" - a display of artifacts that people could not only see and read about, but handle, which would be available for visitors at [where the touch cart is]. That caught my attention immediately. Getting info out the the public was the entire reason that I pursued Classics, and a the one thing that I definitely wanted to do after grad school. If I did a creative project, I would not have to wait until graduation to pursue that goal. My research could be released directly to the public, instead of sequestered in a Master's thesis that no one would read. 

There was only one complication: a touch cart, while being a wonderful format for archaeological research, would be staggeringly underwhelming when presenting literature. I could not imagine that handling my paperback copy of /I, Claudius/ would greatly enhance anyone's educational experience. Still, I was thoroughly sold on the concept of a creative project. I just had to figure out what that project would look like.



Thus, the idea for /The Man, the Myth, the Pumpkin/ was born - and it was absolutely ludicrous. The first problem was that I had no idea whether there would be an audience for the podcast. The entire purpose of doing a creative project, as I have just stated, was to get the information out to whoever wanted it - if nobody wanted it, I might as well have written the formal thesis. I also had no experience scripting, recording, editing, producing, or distributing a podcast. I was not qualified to make this podcast, and had, at the very most, five months to make it happen. And if the Classics department decided that the podcast did not measure up to their standards - standards which had not yet been formally defined, as this was not the usual format for presenting Master's research - I would not receive my degree. 



The first step, now that I had a plan, was to gather primary sources. ...varying levels of difficulty. Despite being the least recent, the ancient sources were the easiest to find. 

The sources from the 20th and 21st century were also widely available, although protected by copyright. 

Unsurprisingly, the medeival depictions of Claudius were by far the most difficult to access. [As an undergraduate, I had spent four years contributing to the Homer Multitext Project, an international initiative that transcribed and digitized Byzantine manuscripts of the Homeric epics. This experience reading manuscripts would prove vital when reading my medeival sources.] This was a good problem to have, as it provided an opportunity to talk about the arbitrary prioritization of ancient historians over medeival historians.



It goes without saying that reading Josephus's history is a vastly different experience than watching porn. 



In order to best... I compiled the following timeline of disability rights movement... There were a couple of inherent challenges to this, the first being the idea of a singular "disability rights movement." For instance, despite being similar in format and released only two years apart, /Caligula/ and /Messalina, Messalina!/ were created in two different countries and thus shaped by different sets of events. The disability rights movement in America was a separate entity from the one going on simultaneously in Italy. However, neither of these movements existed in a vaccuum, and the movements informed and influenced each other. The analysis of these movies in tandem had to acknowledge... without reducing the fight for equality for people with disability down to a single movement with homogeonous, universally understood goals.



/Agrippina/ proved even harder to anaylze through this lens, as disabled voices were rarely elevated or 17th century England, where it was written. And that was only the first level of complication, as George Friedric Handel had spent the first two decades of his life in Germany and moved to Italy before settling down in England; he and his understanding of disability were not defined by a single culture.
