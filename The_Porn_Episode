If the fact that there were two Julio-Claudian pornos released within two years of each other seems surprising, I should probably mention that they are at least partially connected. While /Caligula/ was finished first, several lawsuits prevented it from being released. Enter the production team of /Messalina, Messalina!/, who decided to make use of /Caligula/'s sets. Again, I want to emphasize that these films were produced by two different teams. That means two sets of people in the film industry separately came to the conclusion that Claudius porn was a good idea. And as weird as that is, it's also interesting. Why was this a story that filmmakers in the late seventies were so intent on telling?

First, a rundown of both films. /Caligula/, which obviously takes place first, follows the titular emperor... Despite Claudius the historical figure having been politically active throughout Caligula's reign, Claudius the character does not show up until the very end, when he is unwillingly made emperor a la /Antiquities of the Jews/.

/Messalina, Messalina!/ picks back up a few years later... The "plot" consists of Messalina seeking power by sleeping with various people, until Claudius shows up at the end and puts everyone to death in an extended, gratuitious gore scene.

Now, just from these descriptions alone we can see an important parallel: in both movies, Claudius does not appear until the end. More specifically, Claudius only appears at the tail end of a taboo sexcapade put to an end by violence - in one case his own violence, in the other the violence of a third party. In both of these films about sex, Claudius's appearance marks that the sex has come to an end...

In /Messalina, Messalina!/, every character engaging in sex is able-bodied. In /Caligula/, there actually is a depiction of disabled people having sex - a fetishistic, disgusting depiction. In the film, Tiberius has a "human zoo" filled with people with various disabilities and birth defects. Picture a Victorian sideshow, but everyone is having sex for the benefit of one extremely powerful, extremely perverted old man.
